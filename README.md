# Deep Learning from Scratch

This repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing deep learning models from the ground up. We begin by building fundamental architectures like Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using only NumPy. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of the inner workings of these models.

As we progress, we will leverage powerful open-source libraries such as PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, and Keras to tackle more complex and state-of-the-art problems.

## Projects

Here's a list of the projects completed so far:

### 1. Curve Fitting MLP
- **Description:** A simple Multi-Layer Perceptron built with NumPy to fit a curve to a set of data points.
- **Framework:** NumPy

### 2. MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition CNN
- **Description:** A Convolutional Neural Network for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.
- **Framework:** NumPy

## Future Work

Our journey doesn't stop here. We plan to explore:
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Transformers
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Reinforcement Learning

We will be using PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, and Keras for these future projects.

## Getting Started

To run the projects, you'll need Python and NumPy.

```bash
pip install numpy
```

Then you can run the individual project files.
